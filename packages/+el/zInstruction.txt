this is revised generalized version of extremeanfis algorithm to reduce training time and execution time further

Example:(steps)

[finalRMSE, Parameters] = extremeanfis(trainData,nOutput,nMembershipFn,nEpoches);
output=simextremeanfis(data, Parameters);
[OutputFismat] = extremeanfis2fis(trainData, Parameters);     %optional if sugeno-FIS is required.

{NOTE=> this algorithm is used with any type of system (MISO/SISO/MIMO)}

USES:- 	Modelling MISO/MIMO plants
	Multiclass classification problem
	regression problem
	inverse control
	supportive controller
	online identification
